## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Self-maintaining alert feed.** Alerts get a per-category time-to-live
  (`ALERT_TTL_DAYS_ACTION=14`, `ALERT_TTL_DAYS_MONITORING=3`); a scheduler
  sweep expires past-TTL rows (audited, reversible via
  `POST /alerts/{id}/reopen`) and every surface reads the same live view.
  A repeat of an open alert with the same `(source, dedup_key)` now
  coalesces into the existing card (`occurrence_count`, `last_seen_at`)
  instead of stacking, and only re-pings when severity rose to high/urgent;
  monitoring alerts carry a stable `watch:<slug>` key so one watch means
  one card. A distinct `resolved` status keeps Executive closes separate
  from `ack` (user approved).
- **Executive alert review** (`alert_review_scan`, every 6 h and right before
  the morning brief): re-examines each open alert with evidence — newer
  signals from the same watch, related alerts, activity since, the roster
  with SLAs, department authority — and, through deterministic policy,
  routes + DMs the owner (`propose_via_alert` for propose-only departments),
  nudges, escalates to the principal with a deadline, drafts an artifact,
  suggests a workflow, folds duplicates, or resolves with evidence (high
  confidence only, citing a server-minted evidence ref — free text never
  closes a card; otherwise annotates "likely stale"). Alert text is rendered
  as inert data inside the review prompt (injection boundary); board / comp /
  legal matters only ever go to a scope-holder or the principal and keep
  their text; route/escalate are idempotent across passes; DMs carry an
  "[Alert review] Re: …" header. Capped per pass
  (`ALERT_REVIEW_MAX_MOVES_PER_SCAN`), single-flight, off for every caller
  with `ALERT_REVIEW_ENABLED=false`, every move audited with its evidence and
  prior state, every close reversible. `POST /alerts/review` runs it on
  demand.
- Briefing cards read as decisions: what changed since you last looked, the
  recommended move as the primary control, why-now / due chips, provenance
  (age, seen ×N), "N folded in", a "Handled overnight" rail with Undo, an
  "Executive handled N overnight" pill, a capped "Needs you" list with
  Show more, "Dismiss older than 7 days" (explicit ids), "Re-check
  relevance", and "Mute this topic" on dismiss.
- `POST /alerts/bulk-ack`, `POST /alerts/{id}/reopen`, `POST /alerts/review`.
- Dismissing a watch-sourced alert lowers that watch's `trust_score` (and
  bumps `dismiss_count`); approving recovers it. Trust now discounts the
  ranking and is shown to the review as evidence.

### Changed
- Daily briefs are bounded to "since the last delivered brief": what's new,
  what the Executive handled overnight, who we're waiting on, one top call,
  and a one-line carried-over count. An unchanged day sends
  "Nothing new since yesterday's brief — N items still waiting on you." and
  skips the model call (`PRINCIPAL_BRIEF_SUPPRESS_UNCHANGED`; `force_full`
  on a manual run bypasses it). The EoD digest now excludes monitoring noise.
- The daily reflection sees yesterday's standup and is told not to repeat
  it; the watchlist research council's forced re-run moves from daily to
  weekly (`WATCHLIST_RESEARCH_MAX_STALENESS_HOURS=168`); stalled-workflow
  nudges stop after `NUDGE_MAX_PER_SCOPE=3` per item.
- Alerts created by the Executive's `create_alert` tool now land with their
  `routed_to_person_id` and `department:<slug>` tag (previously every
  triage-born alert fell to the principal as "unrouted").

### Upgrading
- All schema changes are additive columns with defaults (`alerts` table);
  rolling the image back is safe. No config changes are required.
- After upgrading, the first scheduler sweep expires alerts past their TTL
  (audited as `alert_sweep`, reversible with `reopen`); raise
  `ALERT_TTL_DAYS_*` (or set `0`) beforehand to keep an old backlog. The
  review job starts acting within `ALERT_REVIEW_MIN_AGE_HOURS` (2 h) — set
  `ALERT_REVIEW_ENABLED=false` to turn it off, or
  `ALERT_REVIEW_MAX_MOVES_PER_SCAN=0` to keep it annotate-only.
- Briefs get shorter and send a one-liner on unchanged days
  (`PRINCIPAL_BRIEF_SUPPRESS_UNCHANGED=false` restores daily full briefs).
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` now binds the API to `127.0.0.1:8000` instead of
  every host interface. The UI reaches the API over the compose network, so
  nothing in the stack needed the public port. If you were calling `:8000`
  directly from another host, put a reverse proxy in front of it and set
  `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` and `OE_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=1`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

Initial public release.

### Added
- Multi-agent "Executive" system: a single coherent executive persona backed by
  eight specialist sub-agents, powered by the Anthropic Claude API.
- Python backend (`packages/core`) — FastAPI service, orchestrator, specialist
  agents, ChromaDB-backed RAG, CLI, and prompt-caching layer.
- Next.js 15 web UI (`packages/ui`), including the static `/architecture` page.
- Curated MBA knowledge base (`knowledge/`) and eval suite (`evals/`).
- Optional integrations: Slack, Discord, and email.
- Docker deployment configuration.
- Open-source project setup: Apache-2.0 license, contribution guide, code of
  conduct, security policy, issue/PR templates, and CI.
